## Stuff I'm Using

### Claude Sonnet 3.7 as a daily driver and Claude Projects for personal projects
### GPT 4o/4.5 for audio interactions and most in-code API calls
### Deep Research
### DeepSeek V3 and R1 (for less filtered opinions, and especially during a recent trip to Shanghai and Beijing)
### Gemini Flash 2.0 (for very long context interactions)
### GPT 4o-image (Wow!)
### Stable Diffusion 3 (specifically for certain creative upscaling tasks)
### Sora for videos
### Google Notebook LM for podcasts about stuff I want to learn and just for fun
### Manus (dipping my toes in Agentic stuff)
